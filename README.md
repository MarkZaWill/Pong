## Pong
#Attempting to recreate the classic game, ***Pong.


This is my first try to develop a game using **Unity**.  I have commented the code to show my understanding of what I wrote.  I also read a lot of tutorials and the docs for Unity to develop this.  I used *https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pong-game* for some reference to understand some of the mechanics of how Unity works and how to tie the scripts I wrote in Visual Studio to everything else I did in Unity.  


##To play:
Clone or fork this project and pull it down onto your machine and open through Unity.  Click File -> Build & Run -> Save As (select location you want to save this project so you can run it later).  Press Play!

Currently this project is for 2 players.  Player one uses W-> up and S-> down while Player 2 uses the up and down keys respectively.
